"""Run ``uv`` reliably: clean environment, global cache, offline gates.

``uv_gate.py`` is a single stdlib-only file that repositories vendor
byte-for-byte as ``scripts/uv_gate.py``. It implements the procedure in
``uv-robust-execution.md``:

* ``prepare`` runs ``uv sync --locked --offline``. Only when uv proves one of
  four recoverable misses does it run **one** online ``uv sync --locked``: a
  required file missing from the cache (``cache-miss``), an offline resolution
  that needs uncached data (``offline-resolution``), a managed Python download
  that is available but blocked by the offline switch (``missing-python``), or a
  Git source that is not cached (``missing-git-source``).
* ``run`` runs ``uv run --frozen --offline <command>``. It never goes online
  and never retries, whatever the failure.
* ``tool`` runs ``uv tool run --offline`` for a pinned tool. Like ``prepare``,
  it goes online once, and only for the same four proven misses. A tool spec is
  pinned by ``name==VERSION``, ``name@VERSION``, ``git+URL@<full commit SHA>`` or
  the direct reference ``name[extra] @ git+URL@<full commit SHA>``.

Every invocation uses a cleaned environment (no inherited Git configuration,
tokens or ``BASH_ENV``, no ``~/.lody`` on ``PATH``, no Git prompts, and
``/usr/bin/git`` for Git-backed fetches) and the global uv cache. When the
cache and the project's virtual environment are on different filesystems it
sets ``UV_LINK_MODE=copy``.

The helper never refreshes a lock file, never purges a cache and never
retries a failed test, stale lock, authentication error or missing package.
Its exit status is uv's exit status; its own refusals exit with status 2.
Failures print one ``uv-gate: <class>: ...`` line on standard error after uv's
own output, which is passed through unchanged.

Only the short, fixed ``uv cache dir`` query has a timeout. The commands uv
runs for the caller have none, because a test suite may run for a long time:
the CI job's own timeout is their bound.

Python 3.9 or later is enough: the file uses only the standard library.
